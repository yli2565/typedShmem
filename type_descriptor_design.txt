Type descriptor is a combination of string and int

The root level type is described first

6(UInt) vector(char*6) 
5(UInt) float(char*5) 

    Then based on the root type, expect to read

    For primitive, expect nothing (expect the type descriptor to end)
    For vector, expect another type descriptor (can be nested), followed by a UInt describe the size
    For tuple, expect a vector of string descriptor, followed by a vector content
    For mapping, expect a vector if tuple of string descriptor, followed by a vector of tuple of string content
