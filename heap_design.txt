The provided object is a 
ptr + access 

[] operator on the shm object just provide 

an accessor with index/key recorded 
[] on accessor just give another accessor 

dereference only happen when read (convert to other type) / write (assign a value/another accessor) 

if it is a map (rb node)
    hash the input 
    find the corresponding node 
    the node just store a ptr to the real data 
    fetch the read data
if it is a primitive 
    check size 
    return the value
if it is a list 
    check size 
    recursively dereference the ptr in the list

The result will always be a primitive block accessor
